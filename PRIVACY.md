# Privacy Policy for MarkView

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Overview

MarkView is a local Markdown viewer. It does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.**

- No analytics or telemetry
- No crash reports sent externally
- No network requests (except optional remote images you explicitly enable)
- No user accounts or sign-in

## Local Storage

MarkView stores your theme preferences (light/dark mode, color variation) in your browser's local storage. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Can be cleared through your browser settings

## File Access

MarkView reads Markdown files you open and writes temporary HTML files to your system's temp folder for browser rendering. These files remain local to your device.

## Remote Images

If a Markdown file contains remote images, MarkView blocks them by default. If you choose to enable remote images, your browser will fetch them directly from their source servers, which may log your IP address. This is opt-in per document.

## Third-Party Services

MarkView does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs.
